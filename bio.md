He received his B.Engr. degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University in 2012. Then he joined National University of Defence Technology, Changsha, where he received a M.S. degree in 2014. During that time, he visited the City University of Hong Kong for five months, working as a research assistant.

His research topic includes datacenter networking, software-defined networking and big data analytics systems. He loves to learn all kind of new technologies, and he always dreams to develop one than can change the world. Being a little bit geeky, he finds coding very interesting. His favourite editor is Vim.

In his leisure time, Shuhao plays and watches basketball games a lot. He is a die-hard NBA fan who loves Steve Nash, Brandon Roy, Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry. Movies and photography are also his favourites.
